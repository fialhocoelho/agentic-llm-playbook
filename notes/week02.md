# Week 2: Training Systems

Coming soon...

## Planned Topics

- Training loops and gradient accumulation
- Learning rate schedules (warmup, cosine decay)
- Mixed precision training (FP16/BF16)
- Checkpointing and model resumption
- Data loading and preprocessing at scale
- Monitoring and logging (tensorboard, wandb)
- Basic distributed training concepts (DDP)
